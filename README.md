# NetDevOps Live! Better Ansible Network Automation with Roles and Custom Modules
Ansible is an amazing open source tool for getting started with network configuration management. Have you ever noticed how big an complicated your playbooks can get for even basic network configurations? Or have you found something you wanted or needed to do that wasn't included in a module? Or, gasp, a module that didn't quite work as expected?

The code in this repository is explained in NetDevOps Live! season 2 episode 7.

At [NetDevOps Live!](https://developer.cisco.com/netdevops/live/) You can find a recording of this episode as well as all the other episodes from all the seasons of NetDevOps Live!
